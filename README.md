## setup

you will need a developer account to access the spotify API <br>
google for help, then save the ID and SECRET as environment variables <br>
go find a playlist (with a public url) and update the url's array in the main function <br>

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 get_playlist.py
```

many downloads will fail, but some will succeed. Use big playlists <br>
